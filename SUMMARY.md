# InfParquet Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the InfParquet framework according to the requirements specified in Framework.md.

## Core Structure

The InfParquet framework is structured with C components for core functionality and C++ for the high-level framework interface:

1. **Core Components (C)**
   - `parquet_structure.h/c`: Defines and implements the core Parquet file structures
   - `lzma_compressor.h/c`: Implements LZMA2 compression for data
   - `parallel_processor.h/c`: Provides multi-threading capabilities for row-group level parallelism
   - `metadata_types.h`: Defines metadata structures for various types of metadata

2. **Framework Interface (C++)**
   - `infparquet_framework.h/cpp`: Main API for the framework
   - `command_parser.h/cpp`: Handles command-line argument parsing

## Implemented Functionality

### 1. Parquet File Handling

The framework can read Parquet files, analyzing their structure of row groups, columns, and pages. The implementation includes:

- `ParquetFile`, `ParquetRowGroup`, `ParquetColumn`, and `ParquetPage` structures
- Functions to create and release these structures
- Support for different column data types (numeric, string, timestamp, etc.)

### 2. Metadata Generation

Four types of basic metadata are supported:

- **Timestamp Metadata**: Tracks time ranges (min/max timestamps)
- **String Metadata**: Records high-frequency strings and special strings (errors, bugs)
- **Numeric Metadata**: Stores statistical information (min, max, average, mode)
- **Categorical Metadata**: Tracks category frequencies and counts

Metadata is generated at three levels:
- File-level metadata
- Row group metadata
- Column metadata

### 3. Custom Metadata

Support for user-defined metadata via SQL-like queries:
- Users can define up to 20 custom metadata items
- Metadata is stored in a binary matrix format representing results across row groups and columns
- JSON configuration files are used to define custom metadata

### 4. Binary Metadata Storage

Metadata is serialized to a binary format:
- JSON structure is used for metadata organization
- Binary storage reduces disk space and improves parsing speed
- Functions for serialization and deserialization are implemented

### 5. LZMA2 Compression

Column-level compression using LZMA2:
- Each column is compressed separately
- Compression levels from 1-9 are supported
- Custom dictionary sizes can be specified
- Progress reporting via callbacks

### 6. Parallel Processing

Multi-threaded processing at the row group level:
- Automatic detection of optimal thread count
- User-configurable thread count
- Work distribution for both compression and decompression tasks
- Progress reporting across threads

### 7. Command-Line Interface

A comprehensive command-line interface with commands:
- `compress`: Compress a Parquet file with options for metadata generation
- `decompress`: Restore a compressed Parquet file
- `list`: Display metadata information
- `query`: Execute queries against metadata

Command-line options include:
- Compression level
- Parallel task count
- Custom metadata configuration
- Base metadata toggling

### 8. Error Handling

Robust error handling throughout the framework:
- Detailed error messages
- Error code enumeration
- Error callbacks for external error handling

## Third-Party Libraries

External dependencies are properly integrated:
- **Arrow**: Used for Parquet file reading/writing
- **LZMA2**: Used for compression/decompression
- **JSON**: Used for metadata configuration and serialization
- **xxHash**: Used for data validation

All third-party headers are organized in the `include/third_party` directory to ensure consistent inclusion.

## Implementation Details

The implementation adheres to the requirements:
- All code and comments are in English
- Core components use C, while the framework uses C++
- Detailed comments explain the functionality
- Memory management is handled carefully with proper allocation and deallocation
- Third-party libraries are referenced consistently

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for enhancement:
- Additional compression algorithms beyond LZMA2
- More sophisticated metadata query capabilities
- Streaming processing for very large Parquet files
- Integration with big data processing frameworks
